# Moon ContractGuard

API contract verification, implemented in MoonBit with a JSON CLI and reusable library API.

- Repository: [https://github.com/yyqdbngt/moon-contractguard](https://github.com/yyqdbngt/moon-contractguard)
- Package: `yyqdbngt/moon_contractguard@0.1.0`
- License: Apache-2.0
- Release scope: **0.1.0 initial implementation**. The broader competition proposal in `docs/proposal.md` is a reference design, not a claim that every planned capability is implemented.

## Implemented

OpenAPI 3.0 JSON operation inventory; local schema references; typed request parameters; JSON request/response schemas; required fields and additionalProperties; enum/nullable; numeric/string/array/object bounds; uniqueItems; allOf/anyOf/oneOf; bounded validation. Compatibility diff detects removed operations and newly required inputs, with other changes classified for review. scripts/http.mjs checks actual HTTP responses.

## Build and run

Use MoonBit and Node.js 24. The core library supports JS, wasm, wasm-gc and native; the filesystem/HTTP/process CLI is JS only.

```sh
moon update
moon build --target js
moon run cmd/main --target js -- examples/scenario-1.json
node _build/js/debug/build/cmd/main/main.js examples/scenario-1.json
```

Pass `-` to read a UTF-8 JSON request from stdin. A single request must be at most 16 MiB. Successful requests print one JSON result; invalid requests exit nonzero. The host runner is a separate process and does not edit the input request file.

## Library use

```sh
moon add yyqdbngt/moon_contractguard@0.1.0
```

In the consumer's `moon.pkg`:

```moonbit
import {
  "yyqdbngt/moon_contractguard" @engine,
  "moonbitlang/core/json",
}
```

```moonbit
fn example(request : Json) -> Json raise {
  @engine.execute(request)
}
```

`execute(Json) -> Json raise` is the standard JSON boundary. `from_json`, `Value::to_json`, and `run(Value) -> Value raise` provide a typed semantic value interface. Object ordering is not significant; numeric values use finite Double. Public domain functions are listed in `pkg.generated.mbti`.

## Tests

```sh
moon test --target js
moon test --target wasm
moon test --target wasm-gc
moon test --target native  # requires a C compiler
moon build --target js
node scripts/check.mjs
python -B scripts/reference.py

node scripts/integration.mjs
```

There are 8 checked fixture cases in `tests/cases.json`, executed both in MoonBit white-box tests and through the actual Node CLI. Independent reference checks use Python's standard library or separately written algorithms. Fixtures are synthetic and are not presented as production adoption evidence. See [input and output examples](docs/usage.md) and [current boundaries](docs/boundaries.md).

## Current boundaries

A documented OpenAPI 3.0 JSON profile, not complete OpenAPI compliance. Unsupported schema assertions set complete=false; valid=true alone is insufficient. External references, YAML, pattern/format/discriminator/not, response header constraints and non-JSON media are not verified. Compatibility changes with uncertain semantics are review, never automatically declared safe. Path parameter data is path_parameters; path itself is the route template. Query/header parameters must be supplied as typed values matching their schema. Redirects are rejected, response cap 1 MiB, request timeout 10 seconds. HTTP checks can execute supplied methods; use a selected test endpoint.
